    "# The Markov Property\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markov property simplifies the modeling process, as it allows decision-makers to focus on the present state without the need to consider the entire history of states and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Property\n",
    "1. The future is independent of the past, given the present.\n",
    "2. MDPs are memoryless; the current state contains all relevant information for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an MDP, the agent interacts with the environment at discrete time steps $t = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MDP Diagram](../Resources/Images/RL/MDP.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At each time step, the agent receives a representation of the environment, known as the state ($S_t \\in S$).\n",
    "2. Based on the state, the agent selects an action ($A_t \\in A(s)$).\n",
    "3. At the next time step, the agent receives a numerical reward based on its action ($R_{t+1} \\in R$), and the agent transitions to a new state ($S_{t+1}$).\n",
    "4. Therefore, the trajectory is: \n",

    "## Finite MDP\n",
    "\n",
    "In a finite MDP, the sets of states, actions, and rewards all have a finite number of elements. In this case, the random variables $R_t$ and $S_t$ have well-defined discrete probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For particular values of those random variables $s' \\in S$ and $r' \\in R$, there is a probability of those values occurring at time $t$, given the values of the previous state and action:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(s', r' \\mid s, a) = \\Pr(S_t = s', R_t = r' \\mid S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability satisfies the following normalization condition:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\sum_{s' \\in S} \\sum_{r' \\in R} p(s', r' \\mid s, a) = 1 \\quad \\forall s \\in S, a \\in A(s)\n",
